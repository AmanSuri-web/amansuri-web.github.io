		sname:"Ultrasound type is received as safe to use among users, alleviating their concern  about radiation emission as in the case of X-ray.,  Relieve burden on patients as the measurement time is only 15 seconds or less.,  Compact size, easy to move and can  be installed anywhere., Diagnose  osteoporosis by comparing bone mineral density acquired through computer-calculation of ultrasound measurement data,to the mean of sample group and standard deviation.,  Embedded highly  sensitive 6.4” Touch Screen allows for easy and stand-alone measurement, Embedded thermal printer  allows easy, quick, cost-saving printout of the result, guaranteeing optimal  performance during medical examination on the move. Cheaper to maintain due to  the probe made of semi-permanent and highly elastic and safe material, without requiring balloon which uses water or oil.  USB port on the back of the equipment makes patient data management easier.\nMeasurement Method: Ultrasound Measurement Site : Calcaneus(Heel) Measurement Time : 15 sec.,Measurement: SOS-BUA=BQI  Estimated heel BMD and Bone Quality Index (BQI) obtained from measureed Broadband Ultrasound\nAttenuation (BUA) and Speed of Sound (SOS), – Storage Capacity : 10,000 Patient information, , Dimension : 300*620*390 mm, Weight : 12 kg\n\nSKU: MH328A",
